# Assignment 3: Data Manipulation

## How I approach the problems

### count(input)

I initialize an empty object called countObj. This object that store the counts of unique elements in the input array.

If there isn't an element already in an array, we add the element in and set it to 1.

If there is an element already, we add one to the count.

### groupByKey

This is similiar to the last problem, but this time with an object passed in. We can store the value of the input if there is not and add subsequent value to it.
