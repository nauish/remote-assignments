# Assignment 2: Function, Array, and Object

## How I Approached the Problems

I first iterate through the array and add the accumulated values to a variable then divide by the size provided in the object.

I also created another function avgReduce() that uses the reduce method, reduce take in a callback function that has two arguments, an accumulator and the current value.
