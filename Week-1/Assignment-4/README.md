I use **a lot of** CSS flexbox and CSS grid to solve this challenge. My CSS file is very messy for trying to make the grid and navbar behave just like the target page. I challenged myself to use grid and flexbox properties when posible to create responsive design, and only use media quries if needed.

## Instructions Given

> Imitating web pages in the real world is a good way to improve your skills. Your work is to
> create a web page looking as like Google Developers as possible as you can!
> Reminders:
>
> 1.  Before you start coding, look at and play the target page carefully.
> 2.  Take care of the layout first. If you feel it’s not too hard, you can also try to add those
>     dynamic functions like buttons and drop-down menus by javascript.
> 3.  If you can, take care of all the details: sizes, spaces, colors, dimensions, etc. That’s
>     how you can really stand out from others.
